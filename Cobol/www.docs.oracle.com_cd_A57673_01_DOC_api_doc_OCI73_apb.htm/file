Sample Programs in COBOL

    CBDEM1.COB
    CBDEM2.COB
    CBDEM3.COB 

This appendix contains three sample OCI programs written in COBOL. 
The first adds a new employee to a database, the second processes dynamic SQL statements, 
and the third fetches a portion of a LONG or LONG RAW column using OFLNG.

Each of these sample programs is available online. The exact name and storage 
location of these progams is system dependent. See your Oracle system-specific 
documentation for details.
